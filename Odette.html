                Two-Michelin starred Odette is a collaboration between Chef-Owner Julien Royer and The Lo & Behold Group.
                Located at National Gallery Singapore, the restaurant serves Modern French cuisine guided by Royer’s lifelong respect for seasonality,
                terroir and artisanal produce sourced from boutique producers aroundthe world. Odette is named in tribute to Royer’s grandmother who taught him how some of the most
                remarkable dishes can come from the purest ingredients, and believed in ensuring that the fundamental pleasures of enjoying a meal are delivered in the most thoughtful,
                welcoming and hospitable manner. This ethos has directed every aspect of the Odette experience.

                There was a slightly different way of smoking the eggs – pine needles were used instead,
                with the addition of home-made pine oil to infuse the eggs.The eggs were still poached at a precise 63.7 degrees for 55 minutes,
                presented in a similar egg tray with dry ice for dramatic effects.The egg was then poured on the plate with truffle shavings,
                mushrooms and duck pancetta and Forgotten vegetables. Simple and brilliant at the same time.

                The North Highlight Beef Tartare was wonderfully excellent. The beef used was Scottish grass-fed beef, selected for its pure,
                clean flavours, then simply seasoned with smoked bone marrow. The entire dish comprised of many ingredients that all came well together
                , as though they were meant for one another – paper-thin petals of pickled kohlrabi (a German turnip) for gentle crunch,
                grain mustard ice cream which gave a contrasting cold sensation, and a small side of burnt bread topped with mustard seeds.

                The amuse bouche was something I enjoyed tremendously, even surpassing some of my affection for the mains.
                The mushroom tea with ceps sabayon was such a delight which warmed our hearts and the creaminess left us yearning more of it.
